## What is MIRUM?
MIRUM is the world's first plastic-free alternative to leather, offering a sustainable and biobased material solution. It is made from natural rubber, plant oils and waxes, natural pigments, and minerals, ensuring a low-carbon footprint and a naturally circular production process[1][2]. MIRUM is engineered to mimic the look and feel of real leather while being durable and water-resistant, requiring no special care[1].

## Sustainability Features
- **Plastic-Free**: Unlike many vegan leather alternatives, MIRUM does not contain plastics or fossil fuels[2][3].
- **Low Carbon Footprint**: It has a significantly lower carbon impact compared to traditional leather and synthetic alternatives[4][5].
- **Water-Free Production**: The manufacturing process uses no water[2][4].
- **Biodegradable**: At the end of its life cycle, MIRUM can safely return to the earth without causing pollution[4].

## Collaborations and Applications
MIRUM is developed in partnership with Natural Fiber Welding (NFW) and has been adopted by brands like Stella McCartney for luxury fashion products[2][5]. It is versatile and can be used across various industries, offering a range of finishes and colors through its plant-based inputs[1].

## Impact and Innovation
MIRUM represents a significant innovation in sustainable materials, aiming to inspire a shift towards more environmentally friendly practices in the fashion industry[5]. Its production supports local biodiversity and regenerative agriculture, enhancing soil health and reducing environmental impact[3][5].

## Counterfactual Scenarios for MIRUM: A Sustainable Leather Alternative

### 1. **Scenario Name: Continued Reliance on Synthetic Leather Alternatives**
#### Unit of Measurement: Carbon Footprint (kg CO2e per unit of material)
#### Description: In the absence of MIRUM, the fashion industry would likely continue to rely on synthetic leather alternatives, such as polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are derived from fossil fuels and have significant environmental impacts.
#### Expected Impact: The carbon footprint of synthetic leather alternatives is significantly higher than MIRUM. For instance, MIRUM has a carbon footprint up to 10 times lower than traditional synthetic leathers[1][2]. Without MIRUM, the industry would likely see an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of 10 compared to using MIRUM.
#### Relevant Data Points: Synthetic leathers like PU and PVC are non-biodegradable and rely on fossil fuels, contributing to higher carbon emissions[5]. MIRUM, on the other hand, is made from renewable resources and has a much lower carbon footprint[1][3].

### 2. **Scenario Name: Adoption of Other Plant-Based Materials**
#### Unit of Measurement: Biodegradability Rate (%)
#### Description: Without MIRUM, the industry might turn to other plant-based materials like apple or grape leather, which, while sustainable, are not yet fully biodegradable and may not offer the same durability and circularity as MIRUM.
#### Expected Impact: The biodegradability rate of these materials is lower compared to MIRUM, which is fully biodegradable and circular[3]. This could lead to a slower adoption of sustainable practices and a higher environmental impact due to the lack of circularity.
#### Relevant Data Points: MIRUM is USDA-certified 100% biobased and does not contain any plastic or synthetics, making it fully biodegradable[3]. Other plant-based materials, while sustainable, may still contain some synthetic components or lack the circular design of MIRUM[3][4].

**Baseline Research Findings:**
To establish baseline metrics for the counterfactual scenarios involving MIRUM, a sustainable leather alternative, we need to focus on two key areas: the carbon footprint of synthetic leather alternatives and the biodegradability of other plant-based materials.

## Baseline Metrics for Counterfactual Scenarios

### 1. **Carbon Footprint of Synthetic Leather Alternatives**
- **Baseline Metric Name**: Carbon Footprint of Synthetic Leather
- **Unit**: kg CO2e per square meter
- **Baseline Value**: 15.8 kg CO2e per square meter
- **Source**: [2][4]

### 2. **Biodegradability of Other Plant-Based Materials**
- **Baseline Metric Name**: Biodegradability Rate of Plant-Based Materials
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Baseline Value**: Varies, but generally lower than 100% due to potential synthetic components or lack of circular design
- **Source**: [3]

### 3. **Carbon Footprint of Animal Leather**
- **Baseline Metric Name**: Carbon Footprint of Animal Leather
- **Unit**: kg CO2e per square meter
- **Baseline Value**: 110.0 kg CO2e per square meter (including farm emissions), or 17.0 kg CO2e per square meter (excluding farm emissions)
- **Source**: [2][4]

### 4. **Carbon Footprint of MIRUM**
- **Baseline Metric Name**: Carbon Footprint of MIRUM
- **Unit**: kg CO2e per unit of material
- **Baseline Value**: At least 10 times lower than conventional synthetic leathers
- **Source**: [1][3]

### 5. **Biodegradability of MIRUM**
- **Baseline Metric Name**: Biodegradability Rate of MIRUM
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Baseline Value**: 100% biodegradable
- **Source**: [3]

These baseline metrics provide a quantifiable foundation for comparing the environmental impacts of MIRUM with those of synthetic leather alternatives and other plant-based materials. They highlight the significant advantages of MIRUM in terms of carbon footprint reduction and biodegradability. 

### Additional Considerations for Baseline Research

- **Industry Reports**: The leather industry often presents leather as a sustainable by-product, but this overlooks significant environmental impacts like high carbon emissions and biodiversity loss[2].
- **Peer-Reviewed Papers**: Research on sustainable materials often emphasizes the need for biodegradable and low-carbon alternatives to traditional leathers[3].
- **Government Data**: While specific government data on MIRUM or similar materials may be limited, broader environmental impact assessments of the fashion industry can provide context on the need for sustainable alternatives[4].

### Conclusion

MIRUM offers a significant reduction in carbon footprint compared to synthetic leathers and is fully biodegradable, making it a more sustainable choice than many other leather alternatives. The baseline metrics established here provide a clear framework for evaluating the environmental benefits of adopting MIRUM in the fashion industry.
