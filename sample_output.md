## Counterfactual Scenarios for MIRUM: A Sustainable Leather Alternative

### 1. **Scenario Name: Continued Reliance on Synthetic Leather Alternatives**
#### Unit of Measurement: Carbon Footprint (kg CO2e per unit of material)
#### Description: In the absence of MIRUM, the fashion industry would likely continue to rely on synthetic leather alternatives, such as polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are derived from fossil fuels and have significant environmental impacts.
#### Expected Impact: The carbon footprint of synthetic leather alternatives is significantly higher than MIRUM. For instance, MIRUM has a carbon footprint up to 10 times lower than traditional synthetic leathers[1][2]. Without MIRUM, the industry would likely see an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of 10 compared to using MIRUM.
#### Relevant Data Points: Synthetic leathers like PU and PVC are non-biodegradable and rely on fossil fuels, contributing to higher carbon emissions[5]. MIRUM, on the other hand, is made from renewable resources and has a much lower carbon footprint[1][3].

### 2. **Scenario Name: Adoption of Other Plant-Based Materials**
#### Unit of Measurement: Biodegradability Rate (%)
#### Description: Without MIRUM, the industry might turn to other plant-based materials like apple or grape leather, which, while sustainable, are not yet fully biodegradable and may not offer the same durability and circularity as MIRUM.
#### Expected Impact: The biodegradability rate of these materials is lower compared to MIRUM, which is fully biodegradable and circular[3]. This could lead to a slower adoption of sustainable practices and a higher environmental impact due to the lack of circularity.
#### Relevant Data Points: MIRUM is USDA-certified 100% biobased and does not contain any plastic or synthetics, making it fully biodegradable[3]. Other plant-based materials, while sustainable, may still contain some synthetic components or lack the circular design of MIRUM[3][4].
